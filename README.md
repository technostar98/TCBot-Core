#TCBot

Project started:  March 30th, 2015
Project Creators: Technostar98, Horfius, MinecraftDevin11
Description:      This project is intended to create a bot that will help
                  Server Admins and Owners. It will help curate information
                  so that information is easier to get as a client/member.
                  The design will be modular with a basic IRC Bot at the core.
                  This will allow the bot to be customizable based on needs.

#WIP
Yes. It's a WIP. This project is at it's beginnings so most of this is
unstable and alpha code.
