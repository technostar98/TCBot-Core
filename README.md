#TCBot

**Project started:**  March 30th, 2015

**Project Creators:** [Technostar98](https://github.com/technostar98/), [Horfius](https://github.com/Horfius/), [MinecraftDevin](https://github.com/MinecraftDevin/)

**Description:**  This project is intended to create a bot that will help
                  Server Admins and Owners. It will help curate information
                  so that information is easier to get as a client/member.
                  The design will be modular with a basic IRC Bot at the core.
                  This will allow the bot to be customizable based on needs.

#WIP
